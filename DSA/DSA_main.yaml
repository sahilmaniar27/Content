      Common_Mistakes: |
        We might tend to write a new function fo vonverting the given number into a binary number, but we must remember that a number is stored
        as a binary number in the system.
    - Question_2: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor/
      Company_tags: Google, NetApp
      Level: Easy

      Common_Mistakes: |
        This can be the most commonly used function while solving some questions of future topics. The main take away is that it can be solved
        in O(log(n)) time and does not need brute force or factorization.

        Common_Mistakes: |
          We have to keep in mind that the product can become maximum by multiplying negative numbers too (even number of them, obviously).

          This question may seem very simple (in fact, it is)., but, you must remember a couple of things. Use the data-structure "map". This
          makes this problem very easy. This takes care of making key-value pair. Then, we must take care of the return type of the find
          function. Then, we must also be careful while using the iterator and remember to compare it with the end of the map and not the size
          of the input vector.
