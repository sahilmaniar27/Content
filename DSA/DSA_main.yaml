          We might tend to write a new function fo vonverting the given number into a binary number, but we must remember that a number is
          stored as a binary number in the system.

          This can be the most commonly used function while solving some questions of future topics. The main take away is that it can be
          solved in O(log(n)) time and does not need brute force or factorization.

          This question may seem very simple (in fact, it is)., but, you must remember a couple of things. Use the data-structure "map". This
          makes this problem very easy. This takes care of making key-value pair. Then, we must take care of the return type of the find
          function. Then, we must also be careful while using the iterator and remember to compare it with the end of the map and not the size of
          the input vector.
