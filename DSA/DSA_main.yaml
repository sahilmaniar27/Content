Greedy Algorithms:
  Practice_questions:
    - Question_1: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/gas-station/
      Company_tags: Google, D.E. Shaw, Bloomberg, Flipkart, Amazon
      Level: Easy-Medium
      Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-tour-that-visits-all-stations/
      Common_Mistakes: |
        This is not a mistake but a point to remember is that this question can be solved in O(1) space. This can be kept as a contraint by the
        interviewer.
Basic Math:
  Practice_questions:
    - Question_1: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/sum-of-pairwise-hamming-distance/
      Company_tags: Google
      Level: Easy
      Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-bit-differences-among-all-pairs/
      Common_Mistakes: |
        We might tend to write a new function fo vonverting the given number into a binary number, but we must remember that a number is stored
        as a binary number in the system.
    - Question_2: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor/
      Company_tags: Google, NetApp
      Level: Easy
      Solution:
      Common_Mistakes: |
        This can be the most commonly used function while solving some questions of future topics. The main take away is that it can be solved
        in O(log(n)) time and does not need brute force or factorization.

      Company_tags: Microsoft
      Level: Medium
      Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-arithmetic-progression-dp-35/
      Common_Mistakes:
    - Question_2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-of-ways-to-get-a-given-sum-with-n-number-of-m-faced-dices/
      Company_tags: Amazon
      Level: Easy
      Solution:
      Common_Mistakes: |
        We can forget to take care of the base conditions where the required sum is zero or is less than zero.
    - Question_3: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/
      Company_tags: Amazon, Google
      Level: Medium
      Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/palindrome-partitioning-dp-17/
      Common_Mistakes:
    - Question_4: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/min-jumps-array/
      Company_tags: Amazon, Google, Ebay
      Level: Easy - Medium
      Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-of-jumps-to-reach-end-of-a-given-array/
      Common_Mistakes:
    - Question_5: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/total-decoding-messages/0
      Company_tags: Facebook
      Level: Medium
      Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-possible-decodings-given-digit-sequence/
      Common_Mistakes: |
        The complexity of the brute force algorithm is exponential. Take a approach similar to that of Fibonnaci to reduce the time complexity.
    - Question_6: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/word-boggle/0
      Company_tags: Facebook
      Level: Medium

    Practice_questions:
      - Question_1: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/max-product-subarray/
        Company_tags: Amazon, LinkedIn, Microsoft
        Level: Medium
        Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-product-subarray/
        Common_Mistakes: |
          We have to keep in mind that the product can become maximum by multiplying negative numbers too (even number of them, obviously).
      - Question_2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-repeating-and-a-missing-number/
        Company_tags: Amazon, Samsung
        Level: Medium
        Solution:
        Common_Mistakes:
  Linked-List:
  Map:
    Practice_questions:
      - Question_1: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/majority-element/
        Company_tags: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo
        Level: Easy
        Solution:
        Common_Mistakes: |
          This question may seem very simple (in fact, it is)., but, you must remember a couple of things. Use the data-structure "map". This
          makes this problem very easy. This takes care of making key-value pair. Then, we must take care of the return type of the find
          function. Then, we must also be careful while using the iterator and remember to compare it with the end of the map and not the size
          of the input vector.
      - Question_2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-linked-list-with-next-and-arbit-pointer/
        Company_tags: Microsoft, Amazon, Morgan Stanley
        Level: Medium
        Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clone-linked-list-next-random-pointer-o1-space/ #optimal solution (using constant space)
        Common_Mistakes: |
          The interviewer can put a contraint of using a constant space, the solution is provided in the solution link.
      - Question_3: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-and-remove-loop-in-a-linked-list/
        Company_tags: Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung, VMWare, Morgan Stanley, Walmart, Oracle
        Level: Medium
        Solution: https://youtu.be/_BG9rjkAXj8 #solution video
        Common_Mistakes:
Binar Search:
  Practice_questions:
    - Question_1: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/
      Company_tags: Amazon
      Level: Easy-Medium
      Solution:
      Common_Mistakes: |
        Though the array is rotated around a pivot element, we must remember that the two parts are individually sorted. We can keep this in
        mind and think of searching the required element in one go, instead of using two binary searches.

    - Question_1: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/372581
      Company_tags: Amazon
      Level: Medium-Hard
      Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bridge-in-a-graph/
      Common_Mistakes:
Binary Tree:
  Practice_questions:
    - Question_1: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/
      Company_tags: Microsoft, Flipkart, Adobe, Amazon, Google, Oracle
      Level: Medium
      Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-level-level-order-traversal/
      Common_Mistakes: |
        We need to take care of while writing the solution. We should ask the interviewer if the binary tree is a complete binary tree or not
        and proceed accordingly. The solution provided in the link above works for all types of binary trees (complete or not complete).
        But, the algorithm (an extension of pre-order traversal) initial solution uses, DOES NOT work binary trees that are not complete.
